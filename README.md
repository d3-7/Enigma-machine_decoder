# Enigma-machine_decoder
the complete code for the Enigma machine that includes an input field for the user to enter a message they want to encrypt. The script will then display the encrypted results for all combinations of rotor positions.

The script now prompts the user to enter a message that they want to encrypt. The input is stripped of extra spaces and converted to uppercase to match the rotor's expected input format.
The encryption now uses the message provided by the user, and the results are displayed for each combination of rotor positions.
